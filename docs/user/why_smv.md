## Why SMV
* Scales with **DATA** size
* Scales with **CODE** size
* Scales with **TEAM** size

In addition to the data scalability inherited from Spark, SMV also provides code and team scalability through
the following features:
* Multi-level modular design allow developers to work on large scale projects, and enable easy code and data reuse
* Multi-grain traceability to support full scope knowledge transparency to developers and data users
* Provides interfaces to multiple languages(Scala and R for now) for easy integrating to existing code and leverage existing developer experiences
* Pure text code, can utilized modern CM (Configuration Management) tool to track and merge changes among team members
* Automatic Data and Code version synchronization to enable coordination on both code and data level
* Data publishing mechanism to support inter-team coordination
* Build-in data quality management to ensure data quality in a continuous bases
* High level helper functions and tools for quick data App development
