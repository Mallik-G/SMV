Changes since last release:
* Docker SMV image is now synced with SMV binary release.
* `smv-pyrun -s` can now infer the stage name from a partial stage name.
* `smv-core` docker image has been removed. Users should always use `tresamigos:smv` image.
* Removed `smv-class-server`.  Only local mode dynamic loader is available now.
* Removed deprecated DataFrame helpers, column helpers, other functions.
* Removed CDS from SMV (mostly internal).
